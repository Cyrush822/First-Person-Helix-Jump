A 3D, first person version of the popular mobile game Helix Jump!


My first Unity3D game! Simply press A and D to navigate around the different platforms like in Helix Jump.

For the built game, download the .app file.

Game Idea and name belongs to Voodoo games. Everything else (3D models, scripts, sounds, etc.) are all self-made.
